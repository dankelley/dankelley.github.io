# About this blog

This Jekyll-based blog was started January 2014, at which time a few items
previously stored on Wordpress were transferred here.  The advantage of
blogging with Jekyll is mainly that the files are local and can be created in
a standard text editor.  The disadvantages are that (1) anything not in the
Wordpress system is a bit hidden from the blogging community and (2) using
Jekyll is labourious and tricky.

# How to post

Enter the `assets` directory. Create a file with a name like
`yyyy-mm-dd-topic.Rmd` and write an entry. It is easiest to pattern this on
existing entries. Then, type `make yyyy-mm-dd-topic.md` (using your date and
topic, of course). This will create some files, and at the end you'll see
a message telling you what to do next, namely to go up a directory, type `make`
and then git add/commit/push.
