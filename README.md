# About this blog

This Jekyll-based blog was started January 2014, at which time a few items
previously stored on wordpress were transferred here.  The advantage of
blogging with Jekyll is mainly that the files are local and can be created in a
standard text editor.  The disadvantage is that anything not in the wordpress
system is a bit hidden from the blogging community.

# How to post

Enter the `assets` directory. Create a file with a name like
`yyyy-mm-dd-topic.Rmd` and write an entry. It is easiest to pattern this on
existing entries. Then, type `make yyyy-mm-dd-topic.md` (with your date and
topic). This will create some files, and at the end you'll see a message
telling you what to do next, namely to go up a directory, type `make` and then
git add/commit/push.
