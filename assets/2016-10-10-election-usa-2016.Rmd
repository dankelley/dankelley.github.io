# Introduction

There was much to learn from studying how the 2016 USA presidential election
campaign unfolded. The final results have not been tallied to date, although it
the outcome of clear now.

As someone who works in the field of education, I am particularly curious about
the correlation between educational level and voting preference. This is a
matter covered in various exit polls and other studies, but I wanted to get
into the data myself.

This essay tells how I assembled the data and produced a summary plot.

# Procedure

I downloaded state-by-state educational data from [1], and converted to a CSV
file for easier processing (provided at note [2] below). Then I visited [3] and
cut/pasted the results into a file. After editing the percent signs from the
file, I created the file provided at note [4].  Finally, I ran the R code
provided in note [5], to produce the graph shown in the next section.

In this analysis, the focus was on the percentage of the population educated
beyond the Bachelor level, since that proved to be the variable with highest
explanatory power.

As a measure of voting preference, I constructed an index defined as
$(D-R)/(D+R)$, where $D$ is the number of votes cast for the Democrat, and $R$
is the number cast for the Republican. This index would equal zero in a tied
state, with positive values indicating a preference for the Clinton and
negative ones a preference for Trump.  The index is bound, by definition, to
lie between -1 and +1.  I did not perform regression analysis, because it is
unclear what that would mean, for this index. (Indeed, I am not sure such an
index is even used in this field of analysis; I used it because it has proven
to be useful in my field of science.)

# Results

The results of the analysis are presented below.

A educational level of 10.2% was chosen as a cutoff, by visual inspection. The
results may be interpreted as follows.

* There are 18 states in which 10.2% or more of the population holds an
  advanced degree. Of each of these states, the votes for Hillary Clinton
  exceeded those for Donald Trump.
* There are 33 states in which fewer than 10.2% of the population hod an
  advanced degree. Of these, Clinton was preferred in just 3 states, with the
  remaining 30 states voting preferentially for Trump.


# Further steps

I will revisit the data over the next days or weeks, as the data tallies become
more complete. If readers are interested in more details, I would be happy to
post more items to this blog. I have comments turned off for this blog, because
they tend so often to become useless, especially in regards to politics.
