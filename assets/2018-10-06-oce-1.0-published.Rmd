This version is basically version 0.9.24, renamed with first digit being 1, to
indicate a plateau in development. It coincides with the upcoming publication
of my book Oceanographic Analysis with R
(http://dankelley.github.io/book.html). The book should be out before the end
of October, 2018, and is presently available for pre-order from Springer at
https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493988426 and from Amazon at
https://www.amazon.com/Oceanographic-Analysis-R-Dan-Kelley/dp/1493988425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1538313197&sr=8-1&keywords=dan+e+kelley&dpID=31BCT11P-rL&preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch.
