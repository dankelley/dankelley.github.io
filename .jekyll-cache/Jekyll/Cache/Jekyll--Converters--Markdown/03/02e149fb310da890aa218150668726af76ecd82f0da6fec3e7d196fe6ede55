I"<p>Entries are added to this blog simpy by creating files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts/</code> directory.  There is an important convention on the file names: they must start with the year, followed by a dash, followed by the decimal number (with leading zero if appropriate), followed by the day, followed by a dash and then followed by some title words, and with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> at the end.</p>

<p>The format of the blog entries is markdown for the main body, but the first part must be a preface in so-called YAML format.  See any existing blog entry for the format, which should be simple to understand.</p>

<p>Since Markdown errors will cause non-display of the item when it is eventually uploaded to github, it is important to test things locally first.  This is very easy.  In the commandline, type</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">jekyll serve <span class="nt">--watch</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>to start a server.  It will state a local URL that holds the blog.  Cut and past that URL in a browser, and you will see a local copy of the blog.  Every time you edit a file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> will update the blog, but you will need to do a browser refresh to see the results.</p>

<p>Once things work well locally, type the following in a terminal to upload the blog to github.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">make
git add <span class="nb">.</span>
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> MSG
git push</code></pre></figure>

<p>PS. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> part of the above is important, because it moves a tags file from a location where github will not find it, to another where it will be found.  Simply using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> to upload files will give a blog that works in all respects except for tagging, but what would be the point of that?</p>
