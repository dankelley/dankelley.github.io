summary: The method of performing 1D optimization in R is illustrated in the context of gravity-capillary waves.
description: Gravity-capillary waves have a minimum phase speed at a few-centimetre scale.  This scale is found here by using the R function ``optimize()`` to find the minimum speed.

# Introduction

R provides functions for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional optimization.  The second topic is much more complicated than the former (see e.g. Nocedal 1999) and will be left for another day.

A convenient function for 1D optimization is ``optimize()``, also known as ``optimise()``.  Its first argument is a function whose minimum (or maximum) is sought, and the second is a two-element vector giving the range of values of the independent variable to be searched.  (See ``?optimize`` for more.)

# Application

As an example, consider the phase speed of deep gravity-capillary waves, which is given by $\omega/k$ where $\omega$ is the frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber, and the two are bound together with the dispersion relationship $\omega^2=gk+\sigma k^3/\rho$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\sigma$ is the surface tension parameter (0.074 N/m for an air-water interface) and $\rho$ is the water density (1000 kg/m^3 for fresh water).  This yields wave speed given by the following R function.



{% highlight r linenos=table %}
phaseSpeed <- function(k) {
    g <- 9.8
    sigma <- 0.074  # water-air
    rho <- 1000  # fresh water
    omega2 <- g * k + sigma * k^3/rho
    sqrt(omega2)/k
}
{% endhighlight %}


It makes sense to plot a function to be optimized, if only to check that it has been coded correctly, so that is the next step.  Readers who are familiar with gravity-capillary waves may know that the speed is minimum at wavelengths of about 2 cm, or wavenumbers of approximately $2\pi/0.02=300$; this suggests an x range for the plot.  


{% highlight r linenos=table %}
k <- seq(100, 1000, length.out = 100)
par(mar = c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp = c(2, 0.7, 0))
plot(k, phaseSpeed(k), type = "l", xlab = "Wavenumber", ylab = "Phase speed")
{% endhighlight %}

The results suggest that the range of $k$ illustrate contains the minimum, so we provide that to ``optimize()``.


{% highlight r linenos=table %}
o <- optimize(phaseSpeed, range(k))
phaseSpeed(o$minimum)
## [1] 0.2321
{% endhighlight %}


This speed is not especially fast; it would take about a heartbeat to move past your hand.

# Exercises

1. Use ``str(o)`` to learn about the contents of the optimized solution.

2. Use ``abline()`` to indicate the wavenumber at the speed minimum.

3. Try other functions that are of interest to you, e.g. find the angle that maximizes $\sin\theta\cos\theta$, which yields the throwing angle that achieves furthest distance in frictionless air over flat terrain.

4. Use the multi-dimensional optimizer named ``optim()`` on this problem.
