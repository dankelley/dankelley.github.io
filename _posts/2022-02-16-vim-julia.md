title: Setting up vim and tmux to edit/run Julia code

summary: I show how I set up neovim so that I could run Julia from within the editor.  This presumes that tmux is running.

# How to use this setup

Suppose you want to edit a file (`a.jl` say) in neovim and run Julia at the
same time.

1. Start a `tmux` session (if not already started).

2. Type `J a.jl` to split the tmux window vertically, launching neovim editing
   `a.jl` in the top window and running Julia in the bottom window.

3. In the neovim window, type `C-c C-c` to send the code in present paragraph to Julia,
   or type `<space>j` to send just the current line.  (By 'paragraph', I mean
   a block of code ended with a blank line or with the end of file.)

4. Move from paragraph to paragraph, running each.  Or, just don't use
   paragraphs, in which case use either `C-c C-c` or `<space>j`, as you wish.

# Setup

This requires editing some dot files.  I am not going to explain the details of
how this works, and I cannot claim that this will work on all systems.

**Step 1:** edit `~/.zshrc` (or similar) file

If you use the Z shell, edit your `~/.zshrc` file, adding the following (see
e.g. References 1 and 2). (If you use another shell, edit the appropriate file
in a similar way.)

```
function J() {
    tmux send-keys "vim $1" Enter \; \
    split-window -v \; \
    rename-window julia \; \
    send-keys "julia" Enter \; \
    select-pane -t 0 \;
}
```

**Step 2:** edit `~/.vimrc` (or similar) file

Edit your `~/.vimrc` file, adding the following to your Plug setup.  I got much
of this from references 1 and 2. The remapping of `<Space>j` is something I made
up, corresponding to `<Space>r` in R mode.

```
" Slime
let g:slime_target = "tmux"
let g:slime_default_config = {"socket_name": "default", "target_pane": "{last}"}
let g:slime_dont_ask_default = 1
" Julia: make <Space>j run current line. Note that <C-c><C-c> runs paragraph.
autocmd Filetype julia xnoremap <Space>j :SlimeSendCurrentLine<cr>
autocmd Filetype julia nnoremap <Space>j :SlimeSendCurrentLine<cr>
```
