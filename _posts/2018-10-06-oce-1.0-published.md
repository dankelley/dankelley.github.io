This version is basically version 0.9.24, renamed with first digit being 1, to
indicate a plateau in development. This major increase in the version number
also coincides with the upcoming publication of my book *Oceanographic Analysis
with R* [1], due near the end of October, 2018, and available for pre-order
from Springer [2] and Amazon [3].
