        R version 4 will have a new default palette, and it solves the problem of terrible default colours. A simple demonstration is given here.

# The problem of R colours (before version 4.x)

It can be very handy to use numeric colours in R, to distinguish graphical
features.  Commonly, I write something like

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Not run here, so no graph
plot(x, y1)
points(x, y2, col=2)
```
which gives black circles for `y1` and a red one for `y2`.  That works
reasonably well for `col` from 1 to 6, but `col=7` is a yellow that many
viewers find very difficult to see on the white background that are preferred
in technical publications.  Also, some of the colours are more glaring than
others, which leads to an ugly unevenness in the results, and possibly to
confusion, since some viewers might think that the glaring colours are used to
indicate importance (akin to glaring highlighter pen).

# The solution provided in R 4.x

The upcoming R-4 (4.0 is available now as a pre-release, but it is still in
active development and therefore **not recommended** for routine work) will
solve this. The default colours will be more visible, more balanced, and also
better for those with certain vision challenges.

In R-4.0, you can also use the old palettes, so there is no worry about
compatibility with old plots.  A single function call,
```{r}
palette("R3")
```
will switch to the old scheme, so scripts that need compatibility need only
insert a line like this at the top, and the old colours will be used.

```{r echo=FALSE}
palette("R4")
```

# A practical example

Here's a simple example that shows the new scheme
```{r}
x <- 1:8
palette("R4") # not needed unless R3 was previously selected
plot(x, rep(0.9, 8), ylim=c(0.5,1.5), pch=20, cex=4, col=1:8)
palette("R3") # for the old scheme
points(x, rep(1.1, 8), pch=20, cex=4, col=1:8)
```

Many viewers may find the new palette (lower dots) preferable to the old
palette (upper dots).  For me, the biggest improvement is with the yellow dot,
which is clearly visible in R-4.

It is worth noting that the new colours are similar enough to the old ones that
text referring to the diagram may still be valid (``yellow'' is still
``yellow'').

Reference [1] explains more about the new palettes in R-4, and it is worth reading,
to learn about other new palettes that are coming, and about efforts to make
the new results more visible for those with difficulties with colour vision.
