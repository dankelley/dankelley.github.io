# Introduction

There was much to learn from studying how the 2016 USA presidential election
campaign unfolded. The final results have not been tallied to date, although
the outcome is clear now.

As an educator, I am particularly curious about possible linkages between
educational level and voting preference. This is a matter covered in various
exit polls and other studies, but I wanted to get into the data myself.

This essay tells how I assembled and analyzed some relevant data.

# Procedure

I downloaded state-by-state educational data from [1], and converted to a CSV
file for easier processing (provided at note [2] below). Then I visited [3] and
cut/pasted the results into a file. After editing the percent signs from the
file, I created the file provided at note [4].  Finally, I ran the R code
provided in note [5], to produce the graph shown in the next section.

In this analysis, the focus was on the percentage of the population educated
beyond the Bachelor level, since that proved to be the educational variable
with the highest explanatory power.

As a measure of voting preference, I constructed an index defined as
*(D-R)/(D+R)* where *D* is the number of votes cast for the Democrat, and *R*
is the number cast for the Republican. This index is zero in a tied state, with
positive values indicating a preference for Clinton and negative values a
preference for Trump.  By definition, the index is bound to lie between -1 and
+1, i.e. between 100% votes for the Republican and 100% for the Democrat.  I
did not perform regression analysis, because it is not clear what that would
mean if applied to this index.

# Results

The results of the analysis (which may be reproduced by running [5] with datasets [2] and [4])
are presented in the graph shown below. The vertical line indicates an
educational level of 10.2%, which was chosen by visual inspection as a divider
between Trump-favouring and Clinton-favouring educational levels.  The blue
dots indicate a preference for Clinton over Trump.

A noticeable feature is the isolated point indicating high educational level
and strong preference for Clinton. This is the District of Columbia, which may
have a particular reason to favour Clinton, since Trump has pledged to "drain
the swamp."

The overall data cloud reveals stronger trend of preference for Clinton in
states with higher educational level.

Focussing on which candidate won the count, it is possible to construct a
simple statement about the results of this election.

* In 18 of the 18 states in which 10.2% or more of the population holds an
  advanced degree, Clinton is favoured over Trump.

* Trump is favoured in 30 of the remaining 33 states.

# Conclusions

Clinton won a majority of the votes in states with high educational levels.

# Further steps

I plan to revisit the data over the next days or weeks, as the final votes are
tallied. I would be happy to post more items to this blog, if readers contact
me with requests. Please note that this blog does not permit comments, since
they are so often problematic on any blog relating to politics.
